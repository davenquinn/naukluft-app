# Naukluft app

This web app is an application that was used to construct stratigraphic columns
for mapping of the southern Naukluft Mountains in Namibia. The app has heritage
back to 2017, when I was began doing data synthesis for the Naukluft work. It is
built using React/Typescript components that form the basis for the next
generation of work at [Macrostrat](https://macrostrat.org).

## Roadmap

- [ ] Make final publication-quality figures
- [ ] Pull out mapping components into the Mapboard Platform.
