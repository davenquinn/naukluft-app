# Naukluft app development log

## [[2024-09-14]]

Beginning to transition to a much newer application context.
We're going to try to transition to Vike. But we will start
with a static bundle.

- Create a Vike app to bring the API and frontend together
- Remove the separate API
- Remove the `docker-compose` file (we will assume a separately-configured PostgreSQL database and storage bucket)
